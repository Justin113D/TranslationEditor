# Overview
The translation editor toolset consists of 2 apps, one for the developer, and one for the translators.

The developer creates a format using the translation format editor, which contains information about all the texts that need translating.

Once finished, it is handed to the translators, who will load it in the translation editor and translate the texts. Once done, they send either the project or an export of it to the developer, who then gets to use it in their project.

# Getting started
Download the newest version of your needed app from the [releases](https://github.com/Justin113D/TranslationEditor/releases).<br/>
Depending on if you are a developer or translator, you will only need either the format editor, or the translation editor, but not both.<br/>
Both apps have a built-in guide explaining how they work.
